# primality-tests
Python code of testing primality of big numbers using two methods: Solovay-Strassen and Miller-Rabin. This repository is created by collaboration works of the 2018 class of Cryptography, Department of Mathematics, Institut Teknologi Bandung.  

There are two files: main.py and solovay-strassen.py. The first file, main.py file contains the main program for testing primality using both Miller-Rabin and Solovay-Strassen method. On the other side, the second file, solovay-strassen.py contains only the Solovay-Strassen method, but they are optimized.
